Given an integer array data representing the data, return whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding (i.e. it translates to a sequence of valid UTF-8 encoded characters).

A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:

For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its Unicode code.
For an n-bytes character, the first n bits are all one's, the n + 1 bit is 0, followed by n - 1 bytes with the most significant 2 bits being 10.
This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:

     Number of Bytes   |        UTF-8 Octet Sequence
                       |              (binary)
   --------------------+-----------------------------------------
            1          |   0xxxxxxx
            2          |   110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
            3          |   1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
            4          |   11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
x denotes a bit in the binary form of a byte that may be either 0 or 1.

Note: The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.

 

Example 1:

Input: data = [197,130,1]
Output: true
Explanation: data represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.
It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.
Example 2:

Input: data = [235,140,4]
Output: false
Explanation: data represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.
The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.
The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.
But the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.
 

Example 3:

Input: data= [194,155,231,184,185,246,176,131,161,222,174,227,162,134,241,154,168,185,218,178,229,187,139,246,178,187,139,204,146,225,148,179,245,139,172,134,193,156,233,131,154,240,166,188,190,216,150,230,145,144,240,167,140,163,221,190,238,168,139,241,154,159,164,199,170,224,173,140,244,182,143,134,206,181,227,172,141,241,146,159,170,202,134,230,142,163,244,172,140,191]
Output: true
