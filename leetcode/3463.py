Hint
You are given a string s consisting of digits. Perform the following operation repeatedly until the string has exactly two digits:

For each pair of consecutive digits in s, starting from the first digit, calculate a new digit as the sum of the two digits modulo 10.
Replace s with the sequence of newly calculated digits, maintaining the order in which they are computed.
Return true if the final two digits in s are the same; otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "3902"

Output: true

Explanation:

Initially, s = "3902"
First operation:
(s[0] + s[1]) % 10 = (3 + 9) % 10 = 2
(s[1] + s[2]) % 10 = (9 + 0) % 10 = 9
(s[2] + s[3]) % 10 = (0 + 2) % 10 = 2
s becomes "292"
Second operation:
(s[0] + s[1]) % 10 = (2 + 9) % 10 = 1
(s[1] + s[2]) % 10 = (9 + 2) % 10 = 1
s becomes "11"
Since the digits in "11" are the same, the output is true.
Example 2:

Input: s = "34789"

Output: false

Explanation:

Initially, s = "34789".
After the first operation, s = "7157".
After the second operation, s = "862".
After the third operation, s = "48".
Since '4' != '8', the output is false.
 

Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of only digits.

Hint 1
Can we use nCr and use Pascal's triangle values here?
Hint 2
nCr mod 10 can be uniquely determined from nCr mod 2 and nCr mod 5.
Hint 3
Use Lucas's theorem.
