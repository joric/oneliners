Hint
You are given two integer arrays, skill and mana, of length n and m, respectively.

In a laboratory, n wizards must brew m potions in order. Each potion has a mana capacity mana[j] and must pass through all the wizards sequentially to be brewed properly. The time taken by the ith wizard on the jth potion is timeij = skill[i] * mana[j].

Since the brewing process is delicate, a potion must be passed to the next wizard immediately after the current wizard completes their work. This means the timing must be synchronized so that each wizard begins working on a potion exactly when it arrives. â€‹

Return the minimum amount of time required for the potions to be brewed properly.

 

Example 1:

Input: skill = [1,5,2,4], mana = [5,1,4,2]

Output: 110

Explanation:

Potion Number   Start time  Wizard 0 done by    Wizard 1 done by    Wizard 2 done by    Wizard 3 done by
0   0   5   30  40  60
1   52  53  58  60  64
2   54  58  78  86  102
3   86  88  98  102 110
As an example for why wizard 0 cannot start working on the 1st potion before time t = 52, consider the case where the wizards started preparing the 1st potion at time t = 50. At time t = 58, wizard 2 is done with the 1st potion, but wizard 3 will still be working on the 0th potion till time t = 60.

Example 2:

Input: skill = [1,1,1], mana = [1,1,1]

Output: 5

Explanation:

Preparation of the 0th potion begins at time t = 0, and is completed by time t = 3.
Preparation of the 1st potion begins at time t = 1, and is completed by time t = 4.
Preparation of the 2nd potion begins at time t = 2, and is completed by time t = 5.
Example 3:

Input: skill = [1,2,3,4], mana = [1,2]

Output: 21

 

Constraints:

n == skill.length
m == mana.length
1 <= n, m <= 5000
1 <= mana[i], skill[i] <= 5000

Hint 1
Maintain each wizard's earliest free time (for the last potion) as f[i].
Hint 2
Let x be the current mana value. Starting from now = f[0], update now = max(now + skill[i - 1] * x, f[i]) for i in [1..n]. Then, the final f[n - 1] = now + skill[n - 1] * x for this potion.
Hint 3
Update all other f values by f[i] = f[i + 1] - skill[i + 1] * x for i in [0..n - 2] (in reverse order).
