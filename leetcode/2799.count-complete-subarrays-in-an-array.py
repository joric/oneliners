Hint
You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.

We call a subarray of an array complete if the following condition is satisfied:

The number of distinct elements in the subarray is equal to the number of distinct elements in the whole array.
Return the number of complete subarrays.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty part of an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The complete subarrays are the following: [1,3,1,2], [1,3,1,2,2], [3,1,2] and [3,1,2,2].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,5,5,5]
Output: 10
Explanation: The array consists only of the integer 5, so any subarray is complete. The number of subarrays that we can choose is 10.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 2000

Hint 1
Letâ€™s say k is the number of distinct elements in the array. Our goal is to find the number of subarrays with k distinct elements.
Hint 2
Since the constraints are small, you can check every subarray.
